    "In this guide, you will learn about saving and loading checkpoints with Flax and [Orbax](https://github.com/google/orbax). With Flax, you can save and load model parameters, metadata, and a variety of Python data using Orbax. \n",
    "\n",
    "Orbax provides a customizable and flexible API for various array types and storage formats. In addition, Flax provides basic features for versioning, automatic bookkeeping of past checkpoints, and asynchronous saving to reduce training wait time.\n",

    "> **_Ongoing migration:_** In the foreseeable future, Flax's checkpointing functionality will gradually be migrated to Orbax from `flax.training.checkpoints`. All existing features in the Flax API will continue to be supported, but the API will change. You are encouraged to try out the new API by creating an [`orbax.Checkpointer`](https://github.com/google/orbax/blob/main/orbax/checkpoint/checkpointer.py) and pass it in your Flax API calls as an argument `orbax_checkpointer`, as demonstrated later in this guide. This guide provides the most up-to-date code examples for using Orbax and Flax for checkpointing.\n",

This usually happens when the number of devices (CPU/GPU/TPU) is so large that different devices are managed by different hosts (CPU). To get started on JAX in multi-process settings, check out [Using JAX in multi-host and multi-process environments](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multi_process.html) and the [distributed array guide](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Distributed_arrays_and_automatic_parallelization.html).\n",

When a multi-process array is serialized, each host dumps its data shards to a single shared storage, such as a Google Cloud bucket.\n",
