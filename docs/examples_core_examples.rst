Core examples
=============

Core examples are hosted on the GitHub Flax repository in the `examples <https://github.com/google/flax/tree/main/examples>`__
directory.

Each example is designed to be **self-contained and easily forkable**, while
reproducing relevant results in different areas of machine learning.

As discussed in `#231 <https://github.com/google/flax/issues/231>`__, we decided
to go for a standard pattern for all examples including the simplest ones (like MNIST).
This makes every example a bit more verbose, but once you know one example, you
know the structure of all of them. Having unit tests and integration tests is also
very useful when you fork these examples.

Some of the examples below have a link "InteractiveðŸ•¹" that lets you run them
directly in Colab.

Contributing to core Flax examples
**********************************

Most of the `core Flax examples on GitHub <https://github.com/google/flax/tree/main/examples>`__
follow a structure that the Flax dev team found works well with Flax projects.
The team strives to make these examples easy to explore and fork. In particular
(as per GitHub Issue `#231 <https://github.com/google/flax/issues/231>`__):

- README: contains links to paper, command line, `TensorBoard <https://tensorboard.dev/>`__ metrics.
- Focus: an example is about a single model/dataset.
- Configs: we use ``ml_collections.ConfigDict`` stored under ``configs/``.
- Tests: executable ``main.py`` loads ``train.py`` which has ``train_test.py``.
- Data: is read from `TensorFlow Datasets <https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets>`__.
- Standalone: every directory is self-contained.
- Requirements: versions are pinned in ``requirements.txt``.
- Boilerplate: is reduced by using `clu <https://pypi.org/project/clu/>`__.
- Interactive: the example can be explored with a `Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/>`__.
